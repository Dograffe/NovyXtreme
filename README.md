# NovyXtreme

**NovyXtreme** is a re-make of the classic WormholeXtreme plugin, designed for use on Novylenâ€”the oldest Minecraft server. This plugin allows players to create and use obsidian "Stargates" to teleport between locations across the server.

## Features

- **Obsidian Stargates**: Players can build Stargates from obsidian structures, activate them, and use them to teleport between different Stargate locations.
- **Vault Integration**: Connects to Vault to manage in-game currency for Stargate usage.
- **Customizable Options**: Set Stargate creation costs, activation timeouts, and other configurable options via the config file.

## Commands

- `/nxcomplete <stargate-name>`  
  Completes a new Stargate and deducts the configurable cost from the player's account on successful creation (requires an active gate).

- `/dial <stargate-name>`  
  Creates a portal from the activated Stargate to a different Stargate.

- `/nxgo <stargate-name>`  
  Teleports the player to the specified Stargate (does not require a gate to be activated).

- `/nxremove <stargate-name>`  
  Removes the specified Stargate.

- `/nxlist <player-name> (optional) -v (optional)`  
  Lists all Stargates, with optional filtering by player name and a verbose output flag.

- `/nxreload`  
  Reloads the NovyXtreme plugin.
